# 1.0  Amaz0n Homepage Test Plan
We will apply a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach.

The behaviors will be tested in a mix of Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver, to facilitate a learning experience.

## 1.1  Scope
Behaviors that will be tested:
Search and providing an “Overall Pick” item
Login
Logout

## 1.2  Schedule
This project will be initiated on November 10th, 2023 and completed on November 11th, 2023.

## 1.3  Resource Allocation
The tester Daniel Lukich will spend his weekend afternoons on this project for the weekend of November 10th, 2023.

## 1.4  Environment
Browser:  
Chrome Version 119.0.6045.124 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Browser Automation:  
Selenium IDE 4.0.0-alpha.56
Selenium WebDriver, selenium-java 4.15.0
LastPass 4.123.0
IDE:  
IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.2

Language(s) and Dependencies:  
Java 17 (JDK 17.0.8.7)
TestNG (version 7.7.0)
Cucumber (version 7.13.0)

## 1.5  Tools
Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver will be used to automate the browser to test the behaviors.

IntelliJ will be used to develop test code in Java.  TestNG will be the testing framework, which will be used in concert with Cucumber to ensure that simple, executable functional requirements remain in place.


## 1.6  Defect Management
Bugs will be reported in the shared Bug Repository Google Drive Spreadsheet to be reviewed by stakeholders.

Each row represents a bug report.

Columns in each report:
Title
Bug ID (automatically generated)
Steps to Reproduce
Expected Result
Actual Result
Severity/Priority - levels include:  green, yellow, and red.

## 1.7  Risk Management
Present risks include:
Chance of extreme weather disrupting development.
Stakeholders pushing up the deadline.

## 1.8  Exit Parameters
This testing cycle will be considered complete once 95 percent of any red-level severity bugs are eliminated.
